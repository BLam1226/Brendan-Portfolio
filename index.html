        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a 25 year old male currently living in Bucks County PA and taking a full stack web developer bootcamp.
          My only experience is a Python and JavaScript class from my High School Days which was quite a few years ago.
          I love technology and always want to have the most up to date devices and I like to tinker with computers.</p>
